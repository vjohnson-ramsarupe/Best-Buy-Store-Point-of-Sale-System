OVERVIEW

Purpose:	This program simulates a Point of Sale (POS) system for Best Buy Retail Store. It is 
		designed to facilitate sales transactions, manage inventory, and generate receipts. 
		The system allows users to add and remove items from a virtual shopping cart, 
		process payments, and receive a structured receipt for their purchases.


Features & Functionalities:

1. View Store Inventory

- Displays available products, their prices, and current stock levels.

2. Shopping Cart Management

- Add and remove items from the cart.

- Review the cart’s contents and total cost before checking out.

3. Checkout & Payment Processing

- Calculates the total price, including applicable discounts.

- Accepts payments and generates an itemized receipt.

- Ensures a seamless transaction process.

4. Low Stock Warning

- Alerts users when stock levels for an item drop below a predefined threshold.

- Helps store management restock essential items promptly.



Future Enhancements:
- To improve the POS system, consider:

- Adding More Products – Expand inventory with different categories and prices.

- Better Error Handling – Improve input validation to prevent crashes.

- Enhanced Receipts – Format receipts for better readability.

- Multi-Payment Options – Support cash, credit cards, and gift cards.

- Graphical Interface – Better user-friendly design.



Assumptions & Limitations:

The inventory stock is predefined and does not persist once the program is closed.

The system only processes full payments—partial payments or split transactions are not currently supported.

Discounts are applied only if the subtotal exceeds $5000.

The program operates entirely in a terminal-based environment, with no graphical interface at this stage.
